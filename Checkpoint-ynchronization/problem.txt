The checkpoint synchronization is a problem of synchronizing multiple tasks. Consider a workshop where several workers assembling details of some mechanism. When each of them completes his work, they put the details together. There is no store, so a worker who finished its part first must wait for others before starting another one. Putting details together is the checkpoint at which tasks synchronize themselves before going their paths apart.
